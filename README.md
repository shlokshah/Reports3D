##### A deep learning CNN solution which segments brain tumours from MRI scans and reconstructs with accurate location, size and orientation a 3D model of the tumour embedded in the patient brain, available for viewing in an Augmented Reality enviroment.

There exists a vast semantic gap between doctors and patients when it comes to medical imaging. This application is aimed to reduce this communication barrier by making extant tumours easier to visualise in 3 dimensions.

#### Architectue of model: U-NET Model

#### Image segmentation results:
